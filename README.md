# Number Guessing Game 🔢

In this web game, you can guess the number which has been hidden behind the "?". If your guess is wrong, you'll lose point but if you guess is correct, you'll gain more points !!! It's easy, isn't it? Please take a look and try in the demo link below 😁

I have written all the game functions in JavaScript, and the HTML and CSS is based on lecture's files of [@jonasschmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann)
